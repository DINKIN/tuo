# Example iw build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# iw binary. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out completely, if they are not to be included,
# i.e. just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cases, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# Kernel location for GIT NL80211 kernel code (assumed to be running,
# by default); only required if your installed nl80211.h is out of date.

# LibNL location
