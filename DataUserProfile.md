  1. 250kB/user/day


# 3G System Capabilities #


Capability to support circuit and packet data at high bit rates:

  * 144 kilobits/second or higher in high mobility (vehicular) traffic
  * 384 kilobits/second for pedestrian traffic
  * 2 Megabits/second or higher for indoor traffic

HIGH SPEED

Speeds of up to 2 Megabits per second (Mbps) are achievable with Third Generation (3G). The data transmission rates will depend upon the environment the call is being made in- it is only indoors and in stationary environments that these types of data rates will be available. For high mobility, data rates of 144 kbps are expected to be available- this is only about three times the speed of todayâ€™s fixed telecoms modems.

# HSDPA #

HSDPA or High Speed Downlink Packet Access is a 3G enhancement which theoretically supports 14.4Mbps download speeds, though at present it only supports 1.8Mbps download, which is still faster than standard ADSL like Streamyx.

Abdulhadi believes that by the time they launch the service, the technology would enable 3.6 or even 7.2Mbps downloads.

Time began HSDPA trials in May and in FTP download tests found it achieved speeds around **1.6Mbps per user for up to four simultaneous users per cell, while speeds dropped to between 300 and 389Kbps for up to 17 simultaneous users**.

Under normal Web surfing, it average speeds of 1.6Mbps per user with one user, 540Kbps per user with 10 users and 280Kbps per user with 50 users.

These speeds would support audio streaming (up to 60Kbps), online gaming (up to 300Kbps), 1MB downloads (up to 250Kbps) and video streaming (up to 300Kbps). TV requires up to 2.0Mbps, which is achievable with Category 6 user terminal equipment supporting at least 3.6Mbps.
