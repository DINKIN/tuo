#Overview of Robin

= Compile =

Have a look at readme on
[https://www2.hosted-projects.com/trac/ansanto/robin/browser/compiling_robin]

= Flash =

[http://www.open-mesh.com/activekb/questions/8/Flashing+the+Accton+Mini-Router+with+ROBIN]
Use a cross linked cable

= Update =

Robin update its information to server by http/https.
  * crond -c /etc/crontabs. Crond execute scheduled commands. /etc/crontabs/root as follow
{{{
0-59/5  * * * * /sbin/update
22              * * * * /sbin/upgrade
}}}
  First line run the script /sbin/update every 5 minutes to update the information to server.
  Second line run the script /sbin/upgrade on 22 minutes for each hour to upgrade the firmware.
  This file format detail can be found in crontab.
  * /etc/update/ directory contains all update related file. Log is in /tmp/update.log
  * /etc/update/received.clean contains the configuration from the server. /etc/update/update.arg is the uploading information from the local in url format.
  * The scripts in /usr/sbin/update-* will use the file in /etc/update to update the node.

= UCI =

/bin/uci is a script to access the configuration file. It use the /etc/functions.sh and the scripts on /lib/config to access the configuration files on /etc/config

= watchout4node =

script /sbin/watchout4node watch the follow aspects:
  * well known MadWifi/Atheros bugs
  * low memory
  * batmand
  * gateway upstream router connection
  * name server
  * internet connection
  * misc

  According the check results, the node will reboot or /sbin/node_restart

= Speed Limit =

For open access ap, there are download and upload limit. But I didn't figure out how to set this value on the node.

= DHCP =

DNSMasq works as DHCP server on open mesh AP very well. But it can't work with MySecure.

= Routing Table =

To have a look robin's routing table, you should use ip rule and ip route show table XX instead of route, which just output the main routing table. The follow is an example.

{{{
root@open-mesh:/# ip rule
0:      from all lookup local 
6600:   from all to 5.0.0.0/8 lookup 66 
6699:   from all lookup 65

*Important: You have to use /usr/sbin/ip instead of /bin/ip*
