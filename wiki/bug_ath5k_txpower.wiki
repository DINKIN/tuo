#bug report for ath5k txpower setting 

= Introduction =

This is not a critical bug, we can wait until ath5k developer fix the bug or before our release first version.

ath5k doesn't support change the txpower. Correlative function and data structure as follow:

  * iw extension handler define in mac80211

ieee80211_iw_handler_def --> ieee80211_handler -->
ieee80211_ioctl_siwtxpower --> ieee80211_hw_config --> 

  * register data structure.
ath5k_hw_ops --> 

  * handler in ath5k
ath5k_config --> ath5k_chan_set --> ath5k_hw_set_txpower_limit --> ath5k_hw_txpower --> ath5k_txpower_table
