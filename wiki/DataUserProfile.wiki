= 3G System Capabilities =


Capability to support circuit and packet data at high bit rates:

  * 144 kilobits/second or higher in high mobility (vehicular) traffic
  * 384 kilobits/second for pedestrian traffic
  * 2 Megabits/second or higher for indoor traffic

HIGH SPEED

Speeds of up to 2 Megabits per second (Mbps) are achievable with Third Generation (3G). The data transmission rates will depend upon the environment the call is being made in- it is only indoors and in stationary environments that these types of data rates will be available. For high mobility, data rates of 144 kbps are expected to be available- this is only about three times the speed of todayâ€™s fixed telecoms modems.
