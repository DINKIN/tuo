Print Messages

Use printk to print messages in kernel mode, for example

    printk( KERN_INFO, "%s installed, device major number %d\n", DEVICE_NAME, major);

The KERN_INFO specifies the level of message. Kernel message levels are defined in linux/kernel.h

#define	KERN_EMERG	"<0>"	/* system is unusable			*/
#define	KERN_ALERT	"<1>"	/* action must be taken immediately	*/
#define	KERN_CRIT	"<2>"	/* critical conditions			*/
#define	KERN_ERR	"<3>"	/* error conditions			*/
#define	KERN_WARNING	"<4>"	/* warning conditions			*/
#define	KERN_NOTICE	"<5>"	/* normal but significant condition	*/
#define	KERN_INFO	"<6>"	/* informational			*/
#define	KERN_DEBUG	"<7>"	/* debug-level messages			*/

Generally, messages will be log into /usr/adm/messages,/usr/adm/debug, and /usr/adm/syslog (specified in /etc/syslog.conf). It is a good idea to use command tail -f /usr/adm/messages to monitor printed messages, however, you must own root privilege to do that.

Message that priority is higher then KERN_ERR (not included, klogd -c 3) will be direct to system console but X terminal, i.e., if you like to see the critial messages from kernel (modules,) do not load modules within a X terminal. If you insist to do that (display message on X terminal,) write a new printk.

Read manual of klogd (man klogd) for more information.
