#Modification for Supporting Multi-Radio Mesh Node.

= Routing Table =

Find routing item by hashing destination MAC rather than destination MAC and packet incoming interface.

Modify in function 

= PREQ =

Initial node copy the PREQ packet to each Mesh-Point interface in function ....

Forwarding PREQ packet to each Mesh-Point interface in function ....

= Forwarding =
