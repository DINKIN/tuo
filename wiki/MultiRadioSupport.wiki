 * @skb: frame to be sent
 * @dev: network device the frame will be sent through
 *
 * Returns: 0 if the next hop was found. Nonzero otherwise. If no next hop is
 * found, the function will start a path discovery and queue the frame so it is
 * sent when the path is resolved. This means the caller must not free the skb
 * in this case.
